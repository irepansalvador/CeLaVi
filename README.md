CeLaVi (after Cell Lineage Visualisation tool) is a web-based visualisation tool that allows to use data derived from multiple technologies to interrogate the cell lineage whilst visualising the spatial context, the identity and the properties of the cells.

It can be accesed at http://www.celavi.pro/

## Description
CeLaVi is an open-source web tool that can be used without any installation requirements and reads widely-used generic file formats (csv, json, newick) as input, facilitating data interchange between users.coming from different technologies without any software installation requirements. The minimal requirements to use CeLaVi, namely a personal computer with a modern browser, makes it not only useful for cell lineage researchers, but also opens the possibility to the whole developmental biology community, and the general public, to use and explore these wonderful datasets.

## Tutorial
A tutorial showing CeLaVi's main functions is available at  http://www.celavi.pro/tutorial.html.
